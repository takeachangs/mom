**Hackathon's Theme:** Reimagine the cities in Canada to provide innovative and sustainable solutions to the challenges faced by today's youth

**Project Description:** Meet your new MOM! MOM is an AI-integrated productivity Telegram chatbot that significantly reduces the hassle of managing your tasks manually! With a touch of Python, we have created one of the first AI assistant that allows you to make time-sensitive inquiries. With a multithreading approach, you can ask MOM to remind you of your tasks at a certain time or duration, let her know what other tasks you have left, and enjoy `co.chat()` in many more ways!
