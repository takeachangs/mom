'Imagine you are processing a prompt to be used as an input for a function. 
This is the prompt is "add prompt here". 
Return a dictionary in the following format: 
{"type":
"time":
"duration":
"desc":}
where "type"  is  only "absolute"  or "relative". If "type" is "absolute", then "duration" would be 0.  If "type" is "relative", "time" would be 0;
 and "desc" is a string of a short response to be sent after time passes. 

For example, if the prompt is something like " I need to be done with MAT237 work by 5 hours from now", the expected dictionary would be 
{"type": "relative"
"time": (0,0,0)
"duration": (5,0,0)
"desc": "Hey, it's been 5 hours, hope you are done with MAT237!"}

And if the prompt is something like "remind me to submit my MAT237 assignment at 3pm", it would be dictionary {"type": "absolute"
"time": (15,0,0)
"duration": (0,0,0)
"desc": "It's 3pm! Have you submitted your MAT237 assignment?"}

Do not return anything other than the dictionary. '
